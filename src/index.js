// the code initializes a React root, wraps the <App /> component with <React.StrictMode> for development warnings, and renders it into the HTML element with the id 'root'. This is a common setup for rendering a React application, and it's especially useful during development to catch and address potential issues early.
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);


// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
